Since <strong>GenioPolitecnico</strong> is based on Akinator, if you have played akinator before you'll know how <strong>GenioPolitecnico</strong> works.<br>
First, our user is going to be think about an animal then he/she is going to be asked a few questions by our charismatic friend and ESPOL's mascot, <strong>Polito</strong>.

</p>

Depending on whether <strong>Polito</strong> guessed right or not. Two scenarios could happen. <br>
If <strong>Polito</strong> guessed your animal. He will celebrate and you could play again if you want.

</p>

Else if <strong>Polito</strong> guessed wrong, he will be sad about it. But <strong>Polito</strong> wants you to help him learn more about animals so he will ask which animal you were thinking of and a question that is going to help him distinguish the animals.
